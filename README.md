# hello-world

Hello, My name is John. I'm pretty new to coding, I've taken some classes in the past, but I have never practiced.
Over the past year I got really interested into blockchain and smart contracts and now I am learning to code more.
Attending webinars and such is quite fun for me at this time anyway so I might as well learn it while my passion is here.

Thank you for reading, I hope you have a wonderful day and Bless you.
